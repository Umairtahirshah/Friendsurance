Please download and extract the attached solution.

In the attached zipped folder (Solution) youâ€™ll find following documents and a sub folder.
        Questions.docx [Contains answers against the six questions asked on page1 of Friendsurance_QA_Code_Assignment.pdf]
        TestPlan.xlsx [Contains test cases against first two user stories only]
        Defects log sheet.docx [Contain defects found in the application]
        A folder named Expense Tracker (Automation) [Contains automation code done in UFT using VBS with a Readme.txt. on how to execute the script]
Note that following five test cases have been automated,
    To verify that URL launch successfully
    To verify that Login screen opens successfully
    To verify that user can login into the application successfully
    To verify that user can add new category successfully
    To verify that user can add expense against added category

For the test cases, I could only focus on first two provided user stories (Story-001, Story-002) and I hope it will serve the purpose. Writing test cases for all stories requires more time so please let me know if it is mandatory to write cases against other stories too.
Please give the attachments a thorough look and let me know if anything needs further explanation.
